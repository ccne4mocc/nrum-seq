//! Keys a host steals before the editor sees them, and how to hand them back.
//!
//! Some VST3 hosts (REAPER is the usual example) run their own shortcut table ahead of the
//! plug-in window: Space toggles transport and Backspace deletes media even while a text field
//! has focus. nice-plug reports those presses through `Editor::on_virtual_key_from_host`; if the
//! editor claims them the host skips its accelerator. The editor therefore claims a key only
//! while a Slint text field has focus, and replays it into Slint on the window thread.
//!
//! This module is the pure part: which host keys are editing keys, and which Slint key each
//! one becomes. The CLAP wrapper has no such hook, so this is VST3-only behaviour.
